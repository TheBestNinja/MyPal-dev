## Reporting issues & features requests
If you notice any bugs in the project, see some code that can be improved, or have features you would like to be added, please create a bug report or a feature request!

If you want to open a PR that fixes a bug or adds a feature, then it is definitely appreciated if an issue has been created before-hand so it can be discussed first.

## Working on issues

Please feel free to take on any issue that's currently open. Feel free to resolve any issue that you would enjoy working on even if it happens to be a low priority.

## Submitting a PR
- For every PR there should be an accompanying [issue](https://github.com/X-TRON404/MyPal-dev/issues) which the PR solves
- The PR itself should only contain code which is the solution for the given issue
- If you are a first time contributor check if there is a [good first issue](https://github.com/X-TRON404/MyPal-dev/labels/good%20first%20issue) for you
